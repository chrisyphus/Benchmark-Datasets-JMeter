Instructions on how to make and run the test plan on Apache Jmeter is mentioned in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nv0w1a-EDNPNwbQHTNzcrZpT_veTchEgw63i4ugCZkU/edit?usp=sharing.

Note, in order to run the MongoDB test it will require downloading the MongoDB JavaDriver jar and BSON jar from both links listed below. These downloads are contained within the lib of our run. 
https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.mongodb/mongo-java-driver/3.12.11/jar 
https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.mongodb/bson/4.8.1/jar
Similarly, it will require starting a mongo instance through either mongosh or Mongo Compass, and then setting up the database/collection using either the bike_sharing.csv or the walmart.csv files.
