https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nv0w1a-EDNPNwbQHTNzcrZpT_veTchEgw63i4ugCZkU/edit?usp=sharing.

**Running MongoDB with Apache JMeter**  
In order to run the MongoDB test it will require downloading the MongoDB JavaDriver jar and BSON jar from both links listed below. These downloads are contained within the lib of our run. It will then require starting a mongo instance through either mongosh or Mongo Compass, and then setting up the database/collection using either the bike_sharing.csv or the walmart.csv files, both of which are stored within the "databases" folder.
[MongoDB JavaDriver](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.mongodb/mongo-java-driver/3.12.11/jar)  
[BSON](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.mongodb/bson/4.8.1/jar)

**Database preprocessing**   
Substitued 'NA' terms with zeros.
